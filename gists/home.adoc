I have forked this page from the http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/[Vanderbilt University Library] Github site.  Dr. Clifford Anderson, Director of Scholarly Communications, provided me with the technical know-how to do this.  In fact, he did 90% of the work.  
http://neo4j.com[Neo4j] GraphGists are a convenient way to create and share documents containing not just prose, structure
and pictures but most importantly **example graph models and use-cases** expressed in Neo4j's query language http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.1/[Cypher].

These documents are written in AsciiDoc -- the simple, textual markup language -- and rendered in your browser as rich and interactive web pages that you can quickly evolve from describing simple howtos or questions to providing an extensive use-case specification.


 

=== Here are some Graph Gists that have been done at the Heard Library at Vanderbilt University. ===

* http://heardlibrary.github.io/graphgist/?2d0c49d816987ba58c5b/[The Epistolary Correspondence of Flannery O'Connor]
* http://heardlibrary.github.io/graphgist/?3b209f033ab19c0bd876/[The Vane Sisters]

=== Here's how it works: ===

=== 1.  Setup a Graph to show you and your Likes

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(us:Database:NoSql:Graph {name:"Neo4j" })
RETURN you, like, us
----

And render as a graph.

//graph

=== 2.  Now query the graph to show all the things you like

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(liked)
RETURN you.name AS who, type(like) AS how, liked.name AS what
----

And render as a table.

//table

Here's a http://heardlibrary.github.io/workshops/tech/2016/06/01/graphgists.html[tutorial] that will help you get started.
